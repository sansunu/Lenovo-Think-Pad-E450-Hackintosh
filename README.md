# Lenovo Thinkpad E450 Hackintosh Guide for Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur & Monterey with OpenCore
This repo contains the installation guide and EFI files required to get a perfectly functional Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina and Mojave hackintosh on your T450 or T450s since they share the same hardware. Everything is stable and functional as described in this Readme. 

## A few worthy mentions about this repo:

- **This guide is not for models with Haswell 4th gen CPU**
- **The patched ACPI files were first created by [EchoEspirit](https://github.com/EchoEsprit/Hackintosh-Catalina-OpenCore-Lenovo-T450s-efi). I tweaked a couple of things and fixed some errors that were happening on E450 + added Intel WiFi drivers from [Openintelwireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless)**
- **I will try my best to keep the repo updated with the latest kexts and OpenCore version**
- **This EFI works with macOS Ventura, Monterey and Big Sur**
- **With every EFI update you retrieve from here please remember to go through the post install guide**

- Ethernet
- Onboard audio (see post install guide for more info)
- USB 2.0 / USB 3.0
- Dual Batteries
- Touchpad
- Trackpoint
- miniDP
- SD Card Reader (Enable Sinetek-rtsx.kext in Config.plist because it is unstable to be left on by default)
- HiDPI (Use [one-key-hidpi](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi))
- Sidecar (see post install guide for more info)

# What doesn't work

Linux Guide:

Follow this [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/linux-install.html#downloading-macos) to set up the online macOS Big Sur Installer in Linux. I haven't gotten time to write a detailed guide.

The [Dortania Installation Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/) is more detailed and you easily refer to it for more details. I haven't gotten time to write a detailed guide.

## Note: 
## 1. If you are installing Catalina or Mojave it is important that you disable Airportitlwm.kext in Kernel/Add/20 of Config.plist and enable itlwm.kext instead. Read Post Install #4.
## 2. For those having a black screen or frozen installer when booting the install USB, create the USB using macOS and not Linux or Windows. Details on that [here](https://github.com/racka98/Lenovo-Thinkpad-T450-T450s-Hackintosh-Guide-Opencore/issues/2#issuecomment-732408469)

# Post Install
Once you have verifed that your machine boots properly without any issues as described in the "What Works section", proceed to do the following

### 1. Disable Verbose mode (the black screen with logs on boot up)
In Config.plist, navigate to NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> boot-args and delete the `-v` argument

### 2. Disable AppleDebug, ApplePanic & ShowPicker
In the Config.plist, naviaget to Misc -> Debug and change both `AppleDebug` and `ApplePanic` to False (NO)

You can also disable the boot picker screen so that you boot straight to th Apple logo by setting `ShowPicker` under Misc -> Boot to False (NO)

Note: you can still see the boot picker with ShowPicker set to no/false by spamming Esc before the apple logo is displayed during boot.

### 3. Enable WiFi with the Intel card on Monterey, Catalina and Mojave
If you are on Catalina or Mojave, you can enable WiFi on the Intel card by navigating (in config.plist) to Kernel -> Add -> 20 and set Enabled to False/NO (Disabling Airportitlwm.kext) and in 21 set Enabled to True/YES (Enabling itlwm.kext). After enabling these and rebooting install Heliport App (included in Utilities).

Or you can use Airportitlwm.kext for Catalina from Intel WiFi Kexts folder and get native wifi on Catalina in the expense of loosing trackpad after wake from sleep.

**For those on Monterey & Big Sur you can comfortably use the Airportitlwm.kext included as the trackpad issues after sleep do not happen on Big Sur.**

**Note:**

  **1. Airportitlwm.kext gives you native WiFi menu and enables location services, but often causes issues with the trackpad & trackpoint after waking from sleep (it doesn't work) on Catalina and Mojave (not Big Sur). A quick fix is to put the laptop to sleep again by closing the lid until the red sleep light starts to blink then waking the laptop again. Also it only happens when you put the laptop to sleep for a very long time (more than 2 or 3 hours). So for those who don't put their laptop to sleep for a very long time and just turn it off after use, this kext is ok to use.**
  
  **2. The Airportitlwm.kext included in this EFI is for Big Sur. For those in Monterey take the kext in Monterey folder inside Intel WiFi kexts and replace the one in EFI -> Kexts. For those in Catalina or Mojave you should use the one in Intel WiFi Kexts Folder of this repo (Recommended) and replace the one in EFI -> Kexts.**
Note: the Airportitlwm kext for macOS Monterey is very new and may have issues. Please report those issues [here](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/issues).
  
 **3. Airportitlwm causes the bluetooth to be unstable and because so you may experience stutters or interruptions while using bluetooth headphones. To fix this you can turn off wifi and connect via ethernet or you can get 8x series cards to fix this or buy the recomended cards (DW1820A 00JT494 or Broadcom BCM94360CSAX)**

  
### 4. Enable Caps lock indicator and additional Thinkpad features you used to get on Windows
  Using [YogaSMC](https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC) you can gain this functionality back. Install the YogaSMC App-Release from [here](https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC/releases).
  Install it then open it to set it up.
  
### 5. Enabling bluetooth toggle to be able to turn off bluetooth
You can enable IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext & IntelBluetoothInjector.kext to be able to turn off bluetooth by enabling those kexts in config.plist
This is not done by default because it increases boot times
***For those on macOS Monterey do not enable these kexts because the system will not boot***
  
### 6. Add Device Properties for Serial number, MLB, ROM, Sytem-UUID and optionally SystemProductName.
Follow this [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) to set up serial number and the accompanying info to get iServices

If you want to get wired sidecar working, in Config.plist change the string in Platforminfo > Generic> SystemProductName to `MacBook9,1` (note: this causes the battery to drain faster)


### 7. Fix USB mouse side buttons.
If you are using a usb mouse with side buttons, you can spoof apple usb mouse by change the pid and vid in AnyAppleUSBMouse.kext/Info.plist and enable it in Config.plist.


### 8. Fixing static noise
When you connect headphones/earbuds via the headphone jack you will hear static noise. To fix this install alc_fix_new located in Utilities folder of this repo.
